# TODO for Photo Adjustment Task

## Steps from Approved Plan

1. [x] Edit `src/components/Hero.tsx`:
   - Adjusted responsive sizes: base w-32 h-32 (128px), sm:w-40 h-40 (160px), md:w-48 h-48 (192px) for better fit.
   - Added `mt-4` to move the image a little down.

2. [x] Verify the changes:
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
   - Check the hero section visually (optionally use browser to confirm).

3. [x] Update TODO.md to mark completion.
